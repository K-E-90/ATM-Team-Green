This folder will automatically assign procedures to generated aircraft in the scenario.
In order to generate the assigned procedure file called 'proc_init.scn', 
the following files should be in the Contest folder of bluesky:
	- proc_builder.py
	- proc_conditions.txt
	- (proc_README.txt)

Once these are in the contest folder, you can add your constraints to the 'proc_conditions.txt' file. Here you can say which aircraft needs to go to which route depending on certain conditions (dee in the file itself).

Once your conditions are added, open the 'proc_builder.py' and run it.
